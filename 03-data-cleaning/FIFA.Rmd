#Project Description
Your boss at Crunching Numbers needs you to determine which match and stadium had the highest attendance during the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. Use your data import and cleaning skills to dig through the dirty data, clean it up, and present your boss with polished graphs.

These data come from the online 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup match reports (https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/matches/?#groupphase).

#1. Importing data part 1
What an exciting FIFA Women's World Cup! Congratulations to the US Women's National Team and to all the national teams who made the tournament such a great event!

Now that the tournament is over, our boss at Crunching Numbers needs to know which match/stadium had the highest attendance during the women's world cup. Thankfully, one of our trusty interns, Bob, already has the data for us. After chatting with Bob about his football (soccer in the US) obsession, we learned that he collected the data by either watching the games or reading the FIFA Women's World Cup match reports (https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/matches/#groupphase). He manually entered the data into a flat file (.csv) and emailed it to us.
Let's read in the file and explore the raw data!

```{r}
# In this project code scaffolding will only be given for functions that were not 
# explained in the prerequisite courses. Look at the hints if you need help.

# Load the packages
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
# Read in the data from the datasets folder
wwc_raw <- read_csv("2019_WWCFIFA_summary.csv")
```

```{r}
# Check the dimensions of wwc_raw
dim(wwc_raw)
```


```{r}
# Examine the structure of wwc_raw
glimpse(wwc_raw)
```


```{r}
summary(wwc_raw)
```


```{r}
str(wwc_raw)

```

##Task 1: Instructions
Load the packages and read in the data.

1-Load the readr and dplyr packages.
2-Read in the data from the datasets folder using read_csv() and assign it to the variable, wwc_raw. The name of the data file is 2019_WWCFIFA_summary.csv.
3-Determine the class of wwc_raw and its dimensions. Use glimpse(), summary(), and str() to look its structure.

# 2. Importing data part 2
Looking at the outputs, we notice a few things about the data. First, we have some NAs to address. Second, most of the columns are of type character. One of the differences between read_csv() (readr) and read.csv() (utils) is how character strings are treated. With read.csv() strings are coerced to factors, while in read_csv() strings are not coerced. Let's import the data again, but this time, we will assign data types to the Round, Date, and Venue columns.


```{r}
# Read in the data specifying column types
wwc_raw <- read_csv("2019_WWCFIFA_summary.csv",
                col_types = cols(
                                Round = col_factor(),
                                Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"),
                                Venue = col_character()
                                  )
                 )

# Look at the summary and structure of the data
summary(wwc_raw)
glimpse(wwc_raw)

# Print the dataset
print(wwc_raw)
```

##Task 2: Instructions
Import data and assign data types.

1-Use read_csv() to read in the data again. This time parse Round to factor, Date to date, and Venue to factor by setting the col_types argument.
2-Inspect the data by calling glimpse() and summary().
3-The dataset is not large - print it and explore.


#3. Removing rows of NA
We have 55 observations (rows) of 13 variables (columns). Hmmm, we know there were 52 games - why the extra rows? Also Round and Attendance each have three NA, and Date and Venue each have four NA. It looks like we have a few things to fix.

-Rows of NA
-Missing data values
-Multiple values in one column (look at Score and PKS)
-Column headers are a mix of upper- and lowercase letters

The last issue is more of a preference. Having all the column names in the same case will make typing easier.

Great hustle on Bob's part for collecting the information we need, but he gets a yellow card for inserting the rows of NA. Let's start cleaning the data by putting the column names in lowercase and removing the rows of NA.

```{r}
# Load the package
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
# Remove rows of NA and change column names to lowercase
wwc_1 <- wwc_raw %>%
  rename_all(tolower) %>%
  filter(!is.na(round))
```


```{r}
# Get the dimensions of wwc_1
dim(wwc_1)
```


```{r}
# Inspect the first 10 and last 10 rows
head(wwc_1, 10)
tail(wwc_1, 10)
```

##Task 3: Instructions
Change all column names to lowercase and remove rows of NA.

1-Load the tidyr package.
2-Create wwc_1 by first changing all column names to lowercase, then removing rows of NA.
3-Get the dimensions of wwc_1, then inspect the first ten and last ten rows.

One way to remove rows of NA is to filter for !is.na(). Filter on a column of data that has non-NA values in all cells except for the cells that are part of the rows of NAs.

feel free to see the help of the following functions :
rename_all() 
tolower() 
filter() 
is.na() 

#4. Replacing NA
Excellent! We now have 52 rows. Each row corresponds to a match in the tournament. But, it looks like there are a couple NA still lurking about in date and venue. Using colSums() and is.na() we can check to see how many NA are in each column.

![Caption for the picture.](/Users/feryalwindal/Documents/ENSEIGNEMENTS/DOMAINE-BIG-DATA/DATA-REPPORT-COM-VIS/COURS-DATA-REPPORT/Fifa-Q4.png)

We only have the one NA in date and one NA in venue. We would expect the notes column to have several NA, but what about pks? pks is the column for penalty kicks. It has 51 NA. A good guess would be that only one match ended in penalty kicks, and according to Bob, that is correct. We'll deal with the double data in score and pks shortly. Now we are going to clean date and venue.


```{r}
# Housekeeping
wwc_2 <- wwc_1

# Find the index of the NA in the date column
index_date <- which(is.na(wwc_2$date))
```


```{r}
# View the row with the missing date
wwc_2[index_date, ]
```


```{r}
# Replace the NA in the date column with the correct value
wwc_2$date[index_date] <- as.Date("2019-06-09")
```


```{r}
# Find the index of the NA in the venue column
index_venue <- which(is.na(wwc_2$venue))
```


```{r}
# View the row with the missing venue
wwc_2[index_venue, ]
```


```{r}
# Replace the NA in the venue column with the correct value
wwc_2$venue[index_venue] <- "Groupama Stadium"
```


```{r}
# Verify the replacements
colSums(is.na(wwc_2))
```


##Task 4: Instructions
Find the NA and replace them with correct data.

1-Using which() and is.na(), find the index value for the NA in the date column of wwc_2 and assign it to index_date. Use [] to subset and view the row with the missing data, then replace the NA with the correct data value (given).
2-Repeat the process for venue.

A second approach would be to use replace_na().

wwc_2 <-  wwc_1 %>% 
  mutate(date = replace_na(date, "2019-06-09"),
         venue = replace_na(venue, "Groupama Stadium"))

feel free to see the help of the following functions:
which() 
is.na() 
replace_na() 

#5. separate() and replace_na()
All right! The data are looking good, but it is a good idea to get the two data points in score and two data points in pks into their own columns for future data sleuthing.
For this task we're going to employ the functionality of separate(), mutate(), and replace_na(). Look back at the directions in Task 4 to see an example of how mutate() and replace_na() are used together. We'll use the pipe operator, %, to pipe the functions together for readability.


```{r}
print(wwc_2)
```


```{r}
# Separate columns and replace NA (you've got this!)
wwc_3 <- wwc_2 %>%
  separate(score, into = c("home_score", "away_score"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>%
  separate(pks, into = c("home_pks", "away_pks"), sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(home_pks = replace_na(home_pks, 0),
         away_pks = replace_na(away_pks, 0))

# Print the data
print(wwc_3)
```

##Task 5: Instructions
Separte data in columns and replace NA.

1-Create wwc_3 from wwc_2 by calling separate() twice, and then calling replace_na() twice within mutate(). Separate score into home_score and away_score. Separate pks into home_pks and away_pks. Replace the NA in home_pks and away_pks with 0.
2-Print the data and marvel at your awesome data cleaning skills!

Don't forget to corretly set the convert = and sep = arguments in separate(). If you are stuck, check the hint.

feel free to see the help of the following functions:
separate()
mutate()
replace_na()

#6. Plotting for outliers
We corrected the NA in the date and venue columns, and separated the score and pks columns to have one score per column.
Now we can take a look at attendance and find the information the boss wants. Let's plot the data to see if there are any outliers.

```{r}
# Housekeeping for plot size
options(repr.plot.width=6, repr.plot.height=4)

# Load the package
library(ggplot2)

# Create a boxplot of attendance by venue and add the point data
ggplot(data = wwc_3) + aes(x = venue, y = attendance) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(color = "red", size = 0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
```

##Task 6: Instructions
Create a boxplot to look for outliers.

1-Load the ggplot2 package.
2-Using wwc_3, create a boxplot of attendance by venue using geom_boxplot(). The first line of code is the call to ggplot() with the correct x and y aesthetics. The second line of code is the call to the boxplot geometry. Do not forget the +.

geom_jitter() is a convenient way to add random variation to the location of each point. This random variation makes overlapping points easier to visualize.

feel free to see the help of the following functions:
geom_boxplot() 
geom_jitter() 
theme() 


#7. What to do with the outlier?
Whoa! What’s up with the attendance for Groupama Stadium? One data point is almost 600,000 (6e+05) while all the other data points are less than 100,000. That does not seem right.
After chatting with Bob about the outlier and checking the match report, we learned that Bob mistakenly added an extra 0. We can fix that! Let's summarize the attendance by the venue, fix the outlier, and create a new summary table with the updated data.
For fun, add scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) as the last line of the call to ggplot() in Task 6 and see how the y-axis value labels change.

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
# Summarize the number of games, minimum attendance, and maximum attendance at each venue
wwc_venue_summary_initial <- wwc_3 %>%
  group_by(venue) %>%
  summarize(
    num_games = n(),
    min_attendance = min(attendance, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_attendance = max(attendance, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

print(wwc_venue_summary_initial)
```


```{r}
# Correct the outlier
wwc_4 <- wwc_3 %>%
  mutate(attendance = replace(attendance, which(attendance == max(attendance)), 57900))
```


```{r}
# Print an updated summary table
wwc_venue_summary_updated <- wwc_4 %>%
  group_by(venue) %>%
  summarize(
    num_games = n(),
    min_attendance = min(attendance, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_attendance = max(attendance, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(wwc_venue_summary_updated)
```

##Task 7: Instructions
Summarize the attendance at each venue and fix the outlier.

1-Summarize the number of games, minimum attendance, and maximum attendance at each venue in wwc_3.
Use mutate(), and which() within replace(), to update the outlier with the correct value, 57900. Assign the updated dataset to wwc_4.
2-After updating the outlier, summarize the number of games, minimum attendance, and maximum attendance at each venue and print the summary table.

feel free to see the help of the following functions:
group_by() 
summarize() 
replace() and mutate() 


#8. A pretty boxplot
Let's make a boxplot of the attendance by venue again. The first outlier was extreme and might have masked other problems.
This time we will clean up the plot by setting the theme, adding a title, a subtitle, x and y labels, and we will flip the axes to make it easier to read the venue names. We are also going to angle the x-axis text so the numbers will fit within the plot space. And to be fancy, we are going to reorder venue by the attendance within the plot aesthetics so the venues display in descending order of mean attendance.

```{r}
# Housekeeping for plot size
options(repr.plot.width=6, repr.plot.height=4)

# Load necessary packages
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)

# Prettier boxplot of attendance data by venue
ggplot(wwc_4, aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(venue, attendance), y = attendance)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(color = "red", size = 0.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of attendance by stadium",
    subtitle = "2019 FIFA Women's World Cup",
    x = "Stadium",
    y = "Attendance"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
```


##Task 8: Instructions
Redo the boxplot from Task 6. This time make it prettier.

1-Add the correct geometries to create a boxplot of the attendance by venue. Add red, jittered points over the boxplot. Reduce the size of the points to 0.5.
2-Within labs(), add a title, "Distribution of attendance by stadium", and a subtitle, "2019 FIFA Women's World Cup".

Instead of loading the package forcats, we can call the function with forcats::fct_reorder().

feel free to see the help of the following functions:
coord_flip() 
fct_reorder() 

#9. A pretty line plot
Looks good!
That outlier for Stade de Nice looks a little suspect, but we checked the match reports, and the attendance numbers are correct. The suspect match was France vs. Norway - the home nation favorite drew a large crowd wherever they played!
Now that the data are clean, let's plot the attendance at each stadium over time so we can tell the boss which stadium had the highest attendance during the tournament.

```{r}
# Housekeeping for plot size
options(repr.plot.width=6, repr.plot.height=4)

# Line plot of attendance over time
ggplot(wwc_4, aes(x = date, y = attendance, color = venue)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  ) +
  guides(col = guide_legend(nrow = 3)) +
  labs(
    title = "Stadium attendance during the tournament",
    subtitle = "2019 FIFA Women's World Cup",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Attendance",
    color = ""
  )
```

##Task 9: Instructions
Make a line plot of venue attendance over the duration of the tournament.

1-Add the correct x and y aesthetics and color each line by venue.
2-Add the correct geometry to make a line plot.

#10. Wrap up
Congratulations! You've made it to the end of the project.
Great job! We have a couple of beautiful plots to give our boss. With a little more code, we can answer her questions:
1-What match had the highest attendance?
2-In what stadium was the match with the highest attendance played?

```{r}

# What match had the higest attendance? ans_1
# A: wk = SMIF, England vs. USA
# B: wk = FIN, USA vs. Netherlands
# C: wk = SMIF, Netherlands vs. Sweden

# In what stadium was the match with the highest attendance played? ans_2
# A: Groupama Stadium
# B: Parc des Princes
# C: Stade des Alpes

# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)

# Sort the dataset by attendance in descending order
sorted_wwc <- wwc_4 %>%
  arrange(desc(attendance))

# Identify the match with the highest attendance
highest_attendance_match <- sorted_wwc[1, ]

# Assign the correct answers
ans_1 <- "wk = FIN, USA vs. Netherlands"  # Based on the sorted data
ans_2 <- "Groupama Stadium"  # Based on the sorted data

# Print the answers
print(paste("ANSWER 1: wk =", highest_attendance_match$wk, ",", highest_attendance_match$home, "VS", highest_attendance_match$away))


print(paste("ANSWER 2: Stadium =", highest_attendance_match$venue))

```

##Task 10: Instructions
Answer the following multiple-choice questions.

1-Which match had the highest attendance during the tournament?
2-In what stadium was the match with the highest attendance played?
